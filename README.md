## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- MySQL Server
- NetBeans IDE (recommended)
- MySQL JDBC Driver (Connector/J)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InventoryManagement.git
   cd InventoryManagement
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**
   - Create a new MySQL database (e.g., `inventory`).
   - Create the required tables as per the [Database Schema](#database-schema).
   - Update the database connection settings in `src/inventorymanagement/db.java` if needed (default: user `root`, no password).

3. **Add the MySQL JDBC driver:**
   - Download the JAR from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/).
   - In NetBeans: Right-click your project > Properties > Libraries > Add JAR/Folder > select the downloaded JAR.

4. **Build & Run the project:**
   - Open the project in NetBeans.
   - Build (`Clean and Build`) and Run (`Run`).

   Or, using Ant:
   ```sh
   ant clean
   ant build
   ant run
   ```

## üß© How It Works

- **Database Initialization:**
  On first run, ensure the MySQL database and tables exist. The app connects using the credentials in `db.java`.
- **CRUD Operations:**
  All add, remove, and update operations are performed using SQL statements via JDBC.
- **Navigation:**
  Each module is accessible from the Dashboard. Cancel/Back buttons return to the Dashboard.
